# Edgeable

_Current phase: **Idea**_

Enterprise-grade Serverless edge "able" cloud function.

With `Edgeable` you can easily deploy a cloud function to be executed over the edge. using `Edgeable` regularly can help with building request-intensive apps with Micro-servicing and separation of concerns in mind.

## Ready-to-use (RTU) vs Barebone (BB)

When deploying function to `Edgeable` the deployment can be integrated into a RTU worker that enjoys all
other `Edgeable` functionalities, Or, use a BB worker with 100% control over the worker.

### RTU

Ready-to-use workers require the function to be written in a pre-determined way. as the function will run by an
internal `Edgeable` server.

When using RTU worker you can rest assure you're getting the community optimized edition of server implementation for that runtime.

Also, Global KV object are available only for RTU workers. The reason is that the KV object must be injected before it can be used.

Example code of a RTU worker writing in Bun.

```ts
export default async function (ctx: EdgeableContext) {
    // Access a durable globally available KV object.
    const ConfigKV = ctx.durable['ConfigKV'];

    return ctx.json({success: true});
}
```

### BB

Some time there's a need to have full control over the worker. This is very common for custom-made application that you
want to be available over the edge. For that you can create and use a BB worker.

Example code of BB worker writing in Bun

```ts
Bun.serve({
    port: 3000,
    fetch(req) {
        return new Response(JSON.stringify({success: true}), {
            headers: {
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
            }
        });
    },
});
```
